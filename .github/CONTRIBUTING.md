# How To Contribute
WebDevStudios welcomes contributions and bug fixes from third-parties. Here are the steps to get started:

## Reporting Bugs
- Before creating a [new issue](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-blocks/issues), perform a cursory search to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
- Issue titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is about, and should be written in the same style as Git commit messages.
- Do not open a pull request to resolve an issue without first receiving feedback from a collaborator or owner and having them agree on a solution forward.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible; they are immensely helpful.
- Please include full error messages/output when submitting issues where appropriate.
- When submitting a browser bug, please include the browser, version, operating system, and operating system version.

## Internal (WDS) Workflow
Our standard feature/hotfix workflow applies.

* Create a new [issue](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-blocks/issues)
* Create a `feature` or `hotfix` branch off [master](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-blocks/tree/master)
* Commit code changes to your `feature` or `hotifx` branch
* Remember: Continue to merge `master` into your `feature` or `hotifx` branch so it stays current
* Test across all major browsers
* Accessibility testing (both WCAG 2.0AA and Section 508) and pass ESLint
* Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-blocks/pulls) and reference your Issue #
* Notify the project lead
